	                    In the journey of life, I am so much grateful to have you by my side.<br /><br />
						I'm so proud of you, that you still here in this chapter of your life, thriving, making every effort to reach your dreams, and doing your best to heal from what you've experienced.
						Rest assured that I'm here with you, supporting you, and helping you carry your own bordens. And ultimately, know that God is for you. He's got you more than I can. 
						He cares for you so don't stop praying and hoping for God's best for you. We'll get through these together by His grace, and it will become our testimony for God's glory. <br /><br />
						So I hope you won't give up on yourself, and where we are today in this season despite of ups and downs. Let's continue to put Jesus be the center of our relationship. <br /><br />
						I pray that God will give you the desires of your heart as you delight yourself in Him.</font></p>
